# Mental-Health-prediction-
This repository contains the code and dataset for predicting mental health outcomes using machine learning on the OSMI dataset collected over 6 different years.

## Project Overview

Data Merging: Collected OSMI data for 6 years, identified common fields, and merged them into a unified CSV dataset.  
Data Preprocessing: Included scripts for merging, cleaning, and filling missing values. The dataset was encoded, and sentiment analysis was performed on textual responses to extract valuable insights.  
Modeling: Employed Random Forest and other classification techniques to predict mental health outcomes, achieving promising results.  

## Repository Structure

data: Contains the merged CSV dataset.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the data merging, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
